# Surfs Up Challenge
Analysis of Hawaii weather data to be submitted for Challenge #9 of the MSU Data Analytics Course
## Overview of Analysis

### Purpose
This analysis is intended to determine whether multiple businesses are sustainable all year round in Hawaii using weather data.
## Results
1. The first key difference in weather between June and December is the average temperature, which is 75 degrees in June and 71 in December.
2. The second difference in weather is the minimum temperature, which was 64 in June and 56 in December.
3. The third difference in weather is the maximum temperature, with the max in June being 85 and in December being 83.
## Summary
In summary, there are multiple key differences between the weather data for June and December, including the mean, minimum and maximum temperatures. Ultimately, the numbers are not too far off and businesses should be able to be sustained all year round due to the exceptional climate of Hawaii. Two more queries that can be done to gather more data include finding precipitation amounts during the two months and another query to determine if different areas on the islands encounter different temperatures throughout the year.
